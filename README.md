## Vision
The Decentralized Study Group DAO aims to revolutionize the way students collaborate and learn by creating self-governed, blockchain-based communities. Our platform empowers students to form study groups, manage resources, and make collective decisions using governance tokens. This decentralized approach ensures an inclusive, democratic, and engaging learning environment.
